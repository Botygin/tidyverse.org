### Experimental ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg) {#experimental}

Very early days, a lot of churn in search of a good API.  Not on CRAN. Might not go anywhere. Use with care.

### Maturing ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-maturing-blue.svg) {#maturing}

API roughed out, but finer details likely to change. Will strive to maintain backward compatibility, but need wider usage in order to get more feedback.

### Stable ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-stable-brightgreen.svg) {#stable}

We're happy with the API, and the unlikely to be major changes. Backward incompatible changes will only be made if absolutely critical, and will be accompanied by a change in the major version.

### Retired ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-retired-orange.svg) {#retired}

Known better replacement available elsewhere. Will remain  available on CRAN.

### Archived ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-archived-red.svg) {#archived}

Development complete. Archived on CRAN and on GitHub.

### Dormant ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-dormant-blue.svg) {#dormant}

Not currently working on it, but plan to come back to in the future.

### Questioning ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-questioning-blue.svg) {#questioning}

No longer convinced this is a good approach, but don't yet  know what a better approach might be.
